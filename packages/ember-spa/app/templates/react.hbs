<h1>React Route</h1>

<p>This renders a React component inside of the main Ember application using a babel plugin to compile jsx.</p>

<div>
  Pros:
  <ul>
    <li>Simple</li>
    <li>Route transitions will fire correctly in Ember</li>
    <li>No hacky iframe injection</li>
    <li>Theoretically can easily pass data from Ember (like the current user, the current locale, etc) to a React component</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  Cons:
  <ul>
    <li>We will effectively inherit the css baggage from the Ember app</li>
    <li>Tightly couples the React components to have a visual style that only works inside of the Ember app</li>
    <li>Constrains what we can do with React - for example, I don't think we could easily set a top-level global React context since it would likely have to be route-scoped React components, not app-scoped.</li>
    <li>Currently there is an issue with ember-cli-typescript that breaks when using jsx. We use this in our ember application. There might be a workaround, but this might be a deal-breaker. I've filed a Github issue <a href="https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-cli-typescript/issues/1459" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></li>
  </ul>
